# The Odin Project: Recipes

This is a project from The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/recipes).

The goal of this project is to create a simple recipe website using HTML.

The project is simple and straightforward. It requires creating a simple recipe website with a few recipes. The website should have a homepage that lists all the recipes and a separate page for each recipe.

We are not doing any CSS for this project, so the website will be very basic and plain.

Although the project is simple, it is a good way to practice HTML and get familiar with the basics of web development. As I begin my road of becoming a full-stack developer, this is a good refresher of just some basic HTML.

I don't want to skip any projects in the curriculum, so I will be doing this project as well.
